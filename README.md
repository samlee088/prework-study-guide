## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

-The main purpose of this project was to lay out fundamentals and examples for HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding.
-The project helped to lay out the relationships between the 3 coding languagues (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and how they interact with each other to develop coding projects, in this case a website. 
-The primary structure of the languages ; HTML (the overall blueprint), CSS ( the style added to a webpage), Javascript ( the funcational actions of a webpage), was learned and helped to layout the basic building blocks of a coding project, ie a webpage.

## Usage

-This prework study guide lays out a basic overall workflow for a coding project. This starts with downloading applications needed for the modern day workflow and giving a quick user tutorial into these applications ie 'Visual Studio Code', setting up online profiles with websites ie 'Github'. The project then guides a user into the basic building blocks of coding with 3 commonly used languages, "HTML, CSS, and Javascript". The proejct helps to establish each building block, and how they are used with each other to create a coding project, in this case a website. Finally, the user is guided through the final steps of a coding project with deploying the finished project.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
